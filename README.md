<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Tic Tac Toe is a fun game most people know since the beggining of time. The rules are really simple.

There are 2 players, one plays with token "x" and one plays with token "o"
There is a board formed by 9 boxes
Each player gets a turn and selects a box where they want to place their token.
The first player to get 3 tokens aligned in vertical, horizontal or diagonal line wins!.

In this project, we created a tic-tac-toe game that can be played via the command line.
For the implementation of the game we decided to put a number tag from 1 to 9 to each box so users will select a number and their token will be placed in that box. When 3 tokens are aligned, the game will stop and declare a winner.

After each turn, there will be an array displaying the available boxes to choose from. Once the box has been set, it can't be changed, so choose wisely!.

Happy tic-tac-toe games!
